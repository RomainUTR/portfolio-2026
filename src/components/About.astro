                <p class="text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed">
                    Before getting into game programming, I completed <span class="text-white font-medium">a year and a half of a Bachelor's degree in 3D Art & Animation.</span>.

                    I am familiar with the rigour of modelling, UVs and visual constraints. This artistic sensibility now allows me to better understand what I am coding.

                    I'm currently in my <span class="text-white font-medium">1st year of Bachelor's degree in Game Design</span> (Tech & Prog).

                    My ambition is to combine my two skills to become a Tech Artist. I am learning to build tools and shaders to bridge the gap between artists and developers.
